# NLP_in_TensorFlow
Jupyter Notebook created alongside course study in Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow.

## What it covers:
* Text Vectorization (tokenization)
* Creating Embedding layer for model
* Create multiple models using:
  * Naive Bayes (baseline)
  * Simple Dense
  * LSTM
  * GRU
  * Bidirectional-LSTM
  * Conv1D
  * Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
* Compare performance of each model
* Upload data to TensorBoard
* Save/Load best model
* Find most wrong examples
* Speed vs. Score tradeoff
